Given only a pointer/reference to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you delete it?

Given a pointer to a node to be deleted, delete the node. Note that we donâ€™t have a pointer to the head node.

A simple solution is to traverse the linked list until you find the node you want to delete. But this solution requires a pointer to the head node, which contradicts the problem statement.
The fast solution is to copy the data from the next node to the node to be deleted and delete the next node. Something like the following.

// Find next node using next pointer
struct Node *temp  = node_ptr->next;

// Copy data of next node to this node
node_ptr->data  = temp->data;

// Unlink next node
node_ptr->next  = temp->next;

// Delete next node
free(temp);


















#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/* Link list node */
class Node {
public:
	int data;
	Node* next;
};

/* Given a reference (pointer to pointer) to the head
	of a list and an int, push a new node on the front
	of the list. */
void push(Node** head_ref, int new_data)
{
	/* allocate node */
	Node* new_node = new Node();

	/* put in the data */
	new_node->data = new_data;

	/* link the old list off the new node */
	new_node->next = (*head_ref);

	/* move the head to point to the new node */
	(*head_ref) = new_node;
}

void printList(Node* head)
{
	Node* temp = head;
	while (temp != NULL) {
		cout << temp->data << " ";
		temp = temp->next;
	}
}

void deleteNode(Node* node)
{
	Node* prev;
	if (node == NULL)
		return;
	else {
		while (node->next != NULL) {
			node->data = node->next->data;
			prev = node;
			node = node->next;
		}
		prev->next = NULL;
	}
}

/* Driver code*/
int main()
{
	/* Start with the empty list */
	Node* head = NULL;

	/* Use push() to construct below list
	1->12->1->4->1 */
	push(&head, 1);
	push(&head, 4);
	push(&head, 1);
	push(&head, 12);
	push(&head, 1);

	cout << "Before deleting \n";
	printList(head);

	/* I m deleting the head itself.
		You can check for more cases */
	deleteNode(head);

	cout << "\nAfter deleting \n";
	printList(head);
	return 0;
}
